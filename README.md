# Project Title
Netflix Data set

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide valuable data on Netflix, but also streaming services overall. We found a plethora of valuable data that we wish to share with as many people as we can. Part of the reason why we chose the Netflix data set, and streaming related data, is that we are passionate and interested in how streaming services have evolved from the 2000s until now. Overall, we hope that people peruse the variety of code, plots and tables we handmade, focusing on Netflix shows, movies and countries they are featured in. 

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

For this project we got two data sets about Netflix shows and movies. The first dataset includes all of the Netflix shows and movies, if they are gloablly released, the total amount of views, the run time in hours, and the tota amount of views. This dataset came from Netflixs annual, "What we Watched Report 2025". The second data set we used includes; every Netflix title, the director and casts, the origination country, the release year, legnth, and the description on netflix. This dataset was taken from Kaggle. We were given permission from the Professor to use this dataset but we will not be using anycode connected to it. 

## Current Plan

We intend to draw ready and ongoing inferences with Netflix data. To do this, we're taking the top 20 movies, shows, and countries in which they are from and comparing their watch times. This will give us data to further back up our conclusion.
## Repo Structure

The main branch is where we put all of our primary files: the QMD containing all of our pdfs, and code, as well as an area to brainstorm ideas collectively. We also have a dev branch that pertains to each one of us solving our own problems, come up with seeing patterns involving our data, etc.
