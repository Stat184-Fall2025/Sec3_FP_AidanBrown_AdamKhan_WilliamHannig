# Project Title
Netflix Data set

## Overview

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

For this project we got two data sets about Netflix shows and movies. The first dataset includes all of the Netflix shows and movies, if they are gloablly released, the total amount of views, the run time in hours, and the tota amount of views. This dataset came from Netflixs annual, "What we Watched Report 2025". The second data set we used includes; every Netflix title, the director and casts, the origination country, the release year, legnth, and the description on netflix. This dataset was taken from Kaggle. We were given permission from the Professor to use this dataset but we will not be using anycode connected to it. 

## Current Plan

we intend to draw ready and ongoing inferences with Netflix data.
